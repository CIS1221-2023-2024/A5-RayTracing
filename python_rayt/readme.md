### Geometries

This section is to show how is the Vec3 class working and how to generate a Sphere in the Scene

#### Vec3
The Vec3 class represents a three-dimensional vector. It is used to store and manipulate coordinates (x,y,z) in three-dimensional space. 
It is implemented with a series of utility methods to perform basic mathematical operations (+,-,x,/) as well as linear algebra's ones (dot product, cross product, lenght calculations, ecc)
